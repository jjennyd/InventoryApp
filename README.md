# InventoryApp

Hello!

This is a simple program application my partner and I created that keeps track of inventory while also tracking purchases or returns. This program is aimed towards supermarket/grocery stores; however, it could be easily reconfigured to match other types of stores such as a clothing store.

Included is the main function, an inventory class, a transaction class, and the starter text file.
